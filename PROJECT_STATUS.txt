BTC Funding Rates Dashboard - Project Status (as of latest stable version)
=======================================================================

**Current State:**
- The project is a BTC funding rates dashboard with a modern web UI (Coinglass-style), price chart, and matrix tables for USDT and Token-margined exchanges.
- Data is fetched from: binance, okx, bybit, bitmex, kucoin, gate, dydx.
- All funding rates and prices are saved in the SQLite database (`funding_rates.db`).
- The web dashboard is responsive, shows exchange icons, and displays rates as percentages.
- Two stable snapshots are saved: `stable_versions/stable_v1` (first version) and `stable_versions/stable_v2` (latest, full project snapshot).
- The project is now tracked by git, with a `v2.0.0` tag for the current stable version.
- Virtual environment (`venv`) is set up and should always be activated before running anything.

**How to Start Next Time:**
1. Open a terminal and activate your venv:
   source venv/bin/activate
2. Run the app:
   python app.py
3. Visit http://127.0.0.1:5003 in your browser.

**What's Working:**
- Funding rates and prices are fetched and saved for all listed exchanges.
- Data is exported to CSV (`funding_rates_export.csv`) if needed.
- The dashboard UI is modern and matches Coinglass style.
- Project history is tracked in git.

**Next Steps / TODO:**
- Add more analytics or historical charts if desired.
- Add more exchanges if APIs become available.
- Optionally, push the git repo to GitHub for remote backup.
- Review or update the README for onboarding.

**Brief Summary for User:**
- Your BTC funding rates dashboard is fully working, modern, and stable.
- All code, data, and UI are saved in `stable_versions/stable_v2`.
- Always activate your venv before running anything.
- You can view, export, and analyze your data as needed.
