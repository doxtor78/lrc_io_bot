IN-AND-OUT BOT - WHAT'S NEW
===========================

Latest updates and user-requested features:

1. **Robust BitMEX Position Fetching**
   - Fixed position tracking to use BitMEX's private_get_position endpoint and currentQty for the configured symbol.
   - No more 'asset' key errors; works reliably for BitMEX perpetuals.

2. **Clear Action Logging**
   - Prints explicit [ACTION] messages to the terminal and logs whenever the bot opens or closes a position with a limit order.
   - Example: [ACTION] Opening BUY position with LIMIT order for 100 at 103088.5

3. **Timing Information**
   - Prints [TIMING] messages showing how long it takes from signal formation to order placement for both opening and closing positions.
   - Example: [TIMING] Time to OPEN BUY after signal: 0.23 seconds

4. **General Robustness**
   - Modular code structure for easier maintenance and extension.
   - Handles order management, amending/cancelling old or far-from-market orders.
   - Signal confirmation logic and state persistence.

5. **Backup/Stable Version**
   - All code and config files are backed up to /Users/erhangocmez/IN-AND-OUT-BOT as a stable version.
